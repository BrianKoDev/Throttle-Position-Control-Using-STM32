# Project Description
This project uses the STM32 F3 discovery board to demonstrate a throttle control application. The throttle postion is simulated using a 2Hz triangle wave. The potentiometer output is emulated by a DAC. 

## Mode 1 - Potentiometer Test
Shows potentiometer value in LEDs

## Mode 2 - Encoder Test
Shows encoder value in LEDs

## Mode 3 - Combined output
Combines a 5-point moving average of the potentiometer reading and the current encoder counter value
